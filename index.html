    <h1>Alaska in New York</h1>
    <h2>By Aidan Campbell</h2>
    <p>I met my husband in September of 2014. I loved him and he loved me too. I still couldn't get over the timidity of having just settled in America. My husband had been here for 2 years already. We hugged each other tightly, but we were missing something. I left my cat behind when I moved to America and I wanted to adopt a kitten that wouldn't make me feel the absence of my old cat. My husband agreed that we could adopt a cat if I agreed to be with him for the rest of my life. I happily accepted his offer.

We headed to the shelter in Brooklyn and adopted our daughter, Alaska, on October 31, 2014. 

Alaska is still healthy and living with us. We are very happy to have her added to our family. It is very special for me to be able to establish a family of 3 in this huge city where we came as immigrants.</p>
